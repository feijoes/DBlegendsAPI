# DBlegendsAPI

Welcome to DBlegendsAPI!, this API is designed to allow the user to search for character/'s data for the mobile game Dragon Ball Legends. It consists of two main folders: `dbl_scrapper` and `api`.

## Folder Structure

- `dbl_scrapper`: This folder contains the web scrapper that extracts character data from the Dragon Ball space website
- `api`: This folder contains the implementation of the API that serves the extracted character data.

To get started, please refer to the respective `README.md` files in each folder for installation instructions and details on how to execute the code.

## About the project

DBlegendsAPI is a project that I undertook to learn and practice web scraping techniques using Rust. Additionally, it was born out of my frustration with the unavailability of an existing API for accessing data from Dragon Ball Legends.

As a passionate fan of the game, I was eager to explore and analyze character information programmatically. However, my search for a suitable API came up empty. Determined to find a solution, I decided to take matters into my own hands and create my own API.


## Contribution

The API is functional, but it is not yet 100% complete. Currently,the api is only for characters and the scrapper does not search for tag color, stats of transformation characters, and many other things. However, it provides a solid foundation for retrieving basic character data.

If you have any ideas for improvement or additional features, please feel free to create an issue or submit a pull request. I am open to collaboration and would love to work together to make this API even better!
